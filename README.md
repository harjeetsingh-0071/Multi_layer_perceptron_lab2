# Multi_layer_perceptron_lab2
Create a simple 2 layer neural network from scratch without any ML libraries. In this experiment, we are trying to fit random points to a custom function. The program is capable o 


# we can change the number of hidden layers by changing the number of weights and baises for the hidden layers 
In this project, sigmoid function is used for the hidden layer and a linear activation function for the output layer.
